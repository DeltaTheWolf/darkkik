# darkKik
A dark themed replacement for stock kik messenger

# Download
Current Version : 14.9 (Kik's November 2nd Update)

# Features
1. Complete Black UI with a two-tone Teal accent color
2. Unlocked A/B Testing menu (unlocks a plethora of customization options)
3. Patched a bunch of unicode crash codes (causes an overflow in the run time by trying to parse an invalid unicode string
as a website and crashes the main application thread)
  3a. There are hundreds of unicode crash codes so most likely somebody will be able to crash you, i just patched the newer / 
  popular ones
  
 # What's Next
 Features that I *plan* on having ready for the next kik update
 1. Read Reciepts, No Pull, and Disable Typing
 2. Integrated firewall that blocks unsigned/malformed xmpp from unoffical IP addresses or locations (wink wink, a small group 
 within the kik modding community has begun to use xmpp to lock users out of there accounts permanently. There is currently no fix after your account has been bricked, this feature will do it's best to protect you from this, but you could also just not piss off those said people)
