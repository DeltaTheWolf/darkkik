# About

# Changelog
1. Updated A/B Menu 
2. Added 'Enter the Darkness' toast (shows when you open darkKiK)
3. Fixed GIF Search text color
4. Fixed Chat Search text color

# Known bugs

1. Unable to view other users bio's (black text on black background, can't find the necessary
layout file to change the text color)
2. Switching to any other server from the LaForge menu (click the top right corner of the ab menu, the button is invisible) will 
most likely log you out and you will have to go to settings > apps > darkKik > Storage > Clear Data to log back in.
  2a. This is because you are switching kik servers and your account is registered to the production server and will only work 
  on prod and beta servers. If you switch to a dev server and register, you can get into darkKiK but you wont be able to 
  search or message any users or groups.
